# FMDB
The Formulary Management DataBase application is a database of drugs which have been reviewed for inclusion as benefits under the PharmaCare program. It consists of two applications:
  A secure application to add drugs and to search or run reports based on the uploaded data.
  A public webpage where the general public can see which drugs have been reviewed.
