2. All drug reviews completed by the Ministry on or after January 1, 2005.
3. Basic information on the brand name drugs currently under review by the Ministry and the CDR, including

b. the drug's indication - which condition it will be used to treat.
c. The date when the drug was submitted to the Ministry
d. Whether the drug was reviewed by the Common Drug Review (CDR)
e. The date when the Common Drug Review (CDR) recommendation was made
f. The drug's PharmaCare program status (e.g., under review, non-benefit, etc.)
g. The date on which the Ministry's decision was made Formulary Management Database
